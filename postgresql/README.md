This is a PostgreSQL extension that provides access to a Project-OSRM server via plpgsql.

This assumes you have setup you own OSRM server. **PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS ON A PUBLIC SERVER!** as it will most likely get you banned from the server and it can generate a heavy load on the server that other people are trying to use.

This extension works by turning your queries into HTTP requests to the OSRM server and returning the json responses so they can be cached in a table. It also provides functions to extract specific items from a json document so that they can be used.

See the ``test.sql`` files for examples of how to use the various functions.

For PostgreSQL 9.3 there is json parsing support built into the server. For
example:
```
select  id, nfrom, nto, dist,
        (jsonstr->'route_summary')->'total_distance' as osrm_distance,
        (jsonstr->'route_summary')->'total_time' as osrm_time
  from distance_matrix_b  where id=1;
```
