Title: pg2osrm

This document describes the work flow to extract pgRouting topology
into a OSRM normalized file.

Assumptions:
* a table in pgRouting that has been prepared with ``pgr_createTopology()``.
* an optional restrictions table
* pgRouting 2.0.x
* ...

We have to create the files described here:
see: https://github.com/DennisOSRM/Project-OSRM/wiki/OSRM-normalized-file-format

You have to have Project-OSRM checkout, built and referenced in the Makefile. IE: set OSRMDIR= ../Project-OSRM
Make the path appropriate for your locations.

## BUILDING
Since Project-OSRM changes the Normalized Data file format you need to use a version of Project-OSRM that osrm-tools is compatible with. So checkout Project-OSRM like this:
```
git checkout -b osrm-tools v0.3.7-2-gfbbd6ca
```
and build it.

Then change to your osrm-tools/pgr2osrm and edit the Makefile so OSRMDIR points to the Project-OSRM built above.
```
make
sudo cp pgr2osrm /somewhere/in/your/path/.
```

## TESTING
Assuming you have postgresql 9.2 and Postgis 2.x installed. These are just scripts so read them to see what they do.
```
./mk-testdb2 # to create a small test database "osrm_test"
cd test
./extract-ddnoded2 
...
```

Process

The following is basically the SQL that is run by the pgr2osrm command. You
do NOT need to run this SQL, it is only here as a reference.

```

    id serial not null primary key,
    name text
